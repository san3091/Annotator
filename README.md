## Annotator

Annotator is a rails app I created to understand bi-directional, self-referential associations in rails. It was created following closely [Josh Kovach's wakthrough](http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2015/07/30/bi-directional-and-self-referential-associations-in-rails/).

The purpose of this small application is to track relationships between texts. It is a proof-of-concept of sorts for a full fledged research tool, where relationships between texts (in the wide sense of the word) can be tracked and visualized easily.

Basically I'm creating a tool I wish I had when I was writing my undergraduate senior thesis in Eighteenth Century Literature.
